# salt-macros-mlib

## Macro library

This is an attempt to create a reusable macro library to help the development of salt-formulas. Some of the possible benefits of a macro library used through out the salt-formulas are:
* More consistency of code
* Smaller development times
* More consistency in use of helper macros

The idea is to develop a library with macros that are usable in a variety of formulas.

New macros will pop up in the proposed branch. When they're sufficient general applicable and well documented, they'll move to the development branch. Stable macros will get to the master branch.

For simplicity and maintainability, all macros will be available under the same license (Apache 2.0).


## Install

Copy the lib directory to your salt root.
